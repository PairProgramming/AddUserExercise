AddUserExercise
===============

For Pair Programming on a User interface with Cucumber.  The objective is to create static web page that will serve as an add new user form following the TDD (Test Driven Development) methodology; i.e. only writing code in the main application after an appropriate test has been written, and only writing the bare minimum of code necessary to make that test pass.

In particular we recommend trying this exercise in a pair with one of the following [pair programming protocols](http://www.agileventures.org/remote-pair-programming/pair-programming-protocols):

* Ping Pong
* Change the Error
* One Undermanship

Or some combination of the three.  Here is a live example focused mainly on the "Change the Error" protocol using "Github Pong":
